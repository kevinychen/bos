Question 1.
===========

If we have individual handler functions, then we can 1) choose different permissions to run each handler with and 2) have separate behavior for interrupts and exceptions (like interrupts preventing other interrupts).


Question 2.
===========

I didn't have to do anything special. Error code 13 was produced because int $14 is a privileged instruction that cannot be called from user space. If the kernel did allow the user to call int $14, then that will cause problems because the handler for a page fault expects an error code with information about which page was badly accessed.

In general, according to the principle of least permissions we should prevent the user from being able to execute instructions like int $14. Other problems may occur otherwise; there may be other int instructions that no interrupt handler, or the machine probably doesn't want the user to be able to throw errors arbitrarily.
